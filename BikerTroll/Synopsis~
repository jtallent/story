Opens in a biker bar. Bikers partying. Rick is flirting with a Clair. The bikers a playing a raucus drinking game. The rules aren't clear, but it involves a bottle of Tequilla, a live chicken, and a bag of hand granades. Occasionall explosions off stage. Sometimes chcken feathers descend on the characters. Sometimes they dont.

The bartendner, Freda, exposes Rick for a non biker? How does she know? What is he really. I don't know. The bikers menace Rick a bit in prelude to beating him up.

Maybe there should be some action here? Maybe they chase him around the bar? Maybe the bikers start fighint each other. Horace enters, pushing his motorcycle. There's an exchange between he and Freda. Horace gets everyone's attention by honking his horn.'

Or maybe Freda decks Horace, and that's what gets everyone's attention.


Horace is recognized as a legendary biker. He has been pushing his bike for many years. He won't allow another man to work on his bike.
