A biker bar. Partying bikers. A dangerous drinking game involving a bottle of clear liqour, some live chickens and a bucket of hand grenades.
Rick looks like a bad ass, but he're really not. Probably an accountant or a dentist or something. He pisses off Freda the bartender.


There's a map on the wall. It shows the county. The parts they control in one shade, the parts they don't in another shade. Pins here and there. They discuss their criminal enterprises. Rick gets uncomfortable. He tries to skip out unnoncided. Freda stops him.She goads him into allowing her to read his fortune. She applies some carnie psychic skill and exposes Rick. He's not a biker at all. He's an accountant. The other bikers start to kick his ass.

Enter a grizzled old biker. He's pushing his bike. There's a moment of recognition between he and Freda. A brief one. He leans the bike to rest on its kick stand. He attempts to intervene on behalf of Rick.

"Say, does anyone have a points file?"

"For all we know, you're a poser. Maybe we should kick your ass, too."

"He's not a poser," says Freda. "He's the real deal." She pours herself a shot and drinks it. She looks the opposite direction of the grizzled biker.

One of the bikers regocnizes the grizzled biker. He's Bunion Lou. A legend. His bike broke down years ago. Bunion Lou declared he'd fix it himself or push it. So he pushes it.

"Heard you pushed that bike all the way up Berrymander pass."

"Pushed it up Berrymander pass, but not by myself. The whole town of Elk Bluff helped me. They loved me in Elk Bluff."

"There's some steep country between here and Oakmont. How you gonna get over that?"

"Figure I'll have have 'er running soon. And if I don't, maybe you boys'll lend a hand."

Laugher.

"Nobody here loves you. In fact, we're gonna kick your ass."

A biker attacks Bunion Lou. Bunion Lou drops him.

"Maybe Ill  grow on you."

"Oh, we doubt that."

The fight breaks out. The bikers turn on each other so it's a general mele with no discernable sides.

Freda does things to hinder Bunion Lou.


Enter Biker Troll from outer space. Jaws drop. Everythin stops.

"Thank you for agreeing to meet with me."

"We didn't agree to any meeting."

He explains that he comes from outer space. He gives them a speech that stirs up their feelings of patriotism, discontent, alienaion, disturst, racism.

He gets the bikers to help him take over the world. He says it'll be easy. The right combination of brutility and messaging. Government? Look for me at mount Rushmore. I'll be the one in the crown. Religeon? Witty reply to come.
Commerce. When I'm done, you won't be able to buy a bag of chips or a can of beer with my picture on it.

Somebody, a leader maybe, objects so biker troll kills him.

A montoge of three scenes with lighting. Time is marked by the delivery of kegs. During it we see Biker Troll dispatching bikers and gainin power.

Dispath the bikers to do something. They amble off.

Dispatch the bikers to do somethingb else. They salute, but not two of therm.

Disatch them to to somethigne else. They all salute but two are reluctant.

 sure how to stage this. How do I stage that? If an opera can do montoge. Maybe a map on the wall that starts out showing the county with pins and such indicating their holdings and crime activities. Maybe the map is replaced with a map of the state, the county, the world. A scene in the airport? Takes advantage of fear. Passage of time is marked by Beer deliveries, maybe. Kegs of beer wheeled in on Dollies. The map changing. Biker troll dispatching people. The last delivery wheels in a dolly of beer with Biker Troll's face on it. So I guess at some point he declares, 'There won't even be a bottle of beer sold in this world that does't have my face on it!'



Fighting with each other over protection rackets and street corners. No, we're meant for somethign bigger than that. I porpose we tak over the whole world.

The world's pretty big.

Devide and conquore, and the first part they've already done themselves. That map there, do 

Us vs them. What's that on that map? Is that a college? Is this a college town?

State U.

Do you know that there are kids over there at that college and you know what they do there?

No

Study!

Study? How does that help the football team?

Rick, what's going on at that school tonight. Is anybody rallying for anything? Handicap parking. Justice for the oppressed.

The School of Mechanical Engieerig is hosting a demonstration on 

Any

A symposium on ''.

Engineers, huh? You sure there's nothing from the school of Liberal Arts? Cultural Studies, Fine Ats, Musical Theory?

That'll work. Boys, I'm gonna need you to go beat up the School of Engineering.

But what do we have against engineers?

You'll figure that out after you beat them up.

Engineers are a strange and foreign lot. They're to be feared and reviled, and if they're not yet, they will be after we've beeten them up.


Nate and Curtis in Fredas Bar. Bunion Lou working on his bike.

Allison: I still don't understand beating up a bunch of engineering students.

Nate: They're a strange and foreign people.

Curtis: (To Allison) Do you know what they do in that engineering school.

Allison shakes her head.

Curtis: Study!

Nate: They don't do a thing to help the football team.


Freda: Does the community college even have a football team?

Curtis: Maybe not. We're going to beat up a bunch of deadbeats at the state university this week.

Bunion Lou: The governor will send out the national guard.

Freda: Not if he wants to get reelected, listen to this.

She reads a newspaper article. It describes a grass roots movement lead by bikers. Decries elitism. Targets academia. Started with an uprising against academics at a small community college and is spreading accross the county. Biker Gangs have attacked blah, blah, blah.


Back to biker troll.

Biker Troll: Well that's good news Mr. President. Yes, I'm eagerly looking forward to visiting the new wing at the Smithsonian. You say the board of directors is pushing back on the exhibit of me curing cancer? They say it's not hihistorically accurate? And they meet where? When? Biker troll jots down notex and hands it off to a biker. I don't think they're going to be a problem. Keep construction on schedule. And how's it coming with my Nobel Peace Prize? No I not waiting till next year. I want it on my desk by close of business today!'

Biker Troll hangs up.

The phone rings.

Biker Troll: Reverend Billy Joe Barnes! What's the good word? Not that good word, you moron, have you got that fire lit? Your poeple are in the streets on behalf of the Biker Troll cause? Supporting the Biker Troll candidates? Good, very good.

Biker Troll hangs up. He reads a note handed to him by a biker.

What? My guys just got their asses whipped by Smithsonian Board of Directors? How is that possible.


Biker: Those guys had pluck. It was almost like .

Are 




Political and religeous leaders pay homage. But he is snubbed by the nobel committee. 




The president of the united states delivers Harvard's surrender. They're implementing a biker-based dress code, modifying curriculum, and promise to start playing better football.

And my tribute.

They're pulling strings with the nobel committee. I think they're an award coming your way.

What about reliegion? The Reverend Jimmy Ray Barnes of the First Multitunial Righteous Assemblage, The Jesus-Is-Lord Dununciation.. Endorsement of Biker Troll Party candidates. 

Well, that's the last of the Ivy League and I believe that takes care of Academia. What have you got for religion.

All the important onece have swung your way. You got at The Holy Multitude of Devine Denunciation, the Devine Assemblage of Blood Washed. The Reverent Billy Barnes is consturcting a wing. They've added a mural to the Smithsonian themmed The Repression of the normal people like us. The Assembly of Devine Denunciation and they're constructing  anew wing at the Smitshonian dedeicated to blah, blah balkh.

And the media? 








We establish here that it's not enough to go after the elites. He wants to go after the nobles. He learns that the most recent nobel peace prize went to a group. Mothers of Something Or other. They're going to be at the state uivrsity this very evening. He dispatches his bikers to beat them up.






The president of the united states calls. Alignment of values and all that. He offers all fealtyu to biker troll in exchange for his endorsement next election Biker troll promises.

Protestors. Biker troll sends his boys to take care of them. Rick arrannges the Rugby Team to be there instead.

Back at the bar. Freda with some forcepts removing debris from Nate's back.

Nate and Curtis with ice backs and a steak over his eye. Curtis in an splint.



Nate: I never thought I'd get thrown out a window by an engineering student.


Back to biker troll.





A letter from the Nobel Committee. They thank him for his application submitted on his behalf by the dean of the school for engineering. However they can't give him an award. Already voted on it and it went to Hijab wearing muslim women. Their efforts. It happens that they're going to be at State U tonight.




for his effort on behalf of concubine women in outer batswana.

Biker Troll is angry. He's going to send his boys to beat him up. The Nobels!





Biker Troll: On the phone. Yes, yes. Well, someone had to stand up for the common man. That's right, common everyday poeple like me. I know, there'll be some who will miss engineering, and I'm sure they'll take to the streets protesting. You don't have to make everyone happy, just the voting majority.





We'll, I guess we want the trains to run on time, we have to stop beating up engineers. That's OK. They were a gateway patsy, anyway. We need a new them.

Curtis: Hippies? The media? The deep state?

Movement spreads. People start beating up university students all over the world. Biker troll beer. Step things up.




Biker Troll: All that's been done already. This is world conguest. We have to think out of the box.

Hey, this Nobel Committee? Where are they.

Somebody argues.

Biker Troll: But one thing I have to do first ...

Biker: Yeah?

Biker Troll: Kill you for argueing with me.






The beer man wheels a keg of beer in. Now he's wearing biker atire. Compnay logo on his vest.

How are they going to thwart him? Can they pose as engineerng students and fight back?


Back in the bar.

Rick: Maybe it was some sort of figurative beating up of the deadbeats.

Freda: We can't let this happen.

Bunion Lou: WE can't?

Freda: You've got to go train the Nobel committee in Kung Fu.

Bunion Lou: I don't know Kung Fu.

Freda: There must be something we can do.

The nobel commmittee is coming here to surrender.

Here is you nobel peace prize for your representation of the common man ...






Switzerland, I think. Nobels. Yeah. Us against the nobels.


They go beat up the nobel committee. But they fail for some reason. 








Nate: State University does. And their engineering program doesn't do anything to help their team either. So we're going to beat them up tonight. All the biker gangs are. The governer has called out the national guard to try to protect them.


Cops come, but biker troll turns them to his side.



It doesn't. Let's go beat of the school of engineering?




Maybe from where you sit, but I can tell you it' all messageing. Messaging, and just the right amount of brutality. Let's start with what we've got. Which is this bar, and some vices. A few photos of some local congressmen and beefore long, we're a statewide operation. Influence. That's the stuff of conquest. People love to be influenced. They're yearning for it. Sign on to lies they already believe. Next thing you know, we're picking heads of states.

The dissafected and everyone's disaffected. The more disaffected, the more they'll appreciate our divine whipping of ass.

We need to find some really smart, educated poeple. People with integrety.

So we can turn them to our side?

No, so we can beat the hell out of them.

Rick, this Nobel Committee, where are they?

Switzerland.

Boys, we're going to switzerland to beat up the nobel Committee.

On our way to the airport.

They go to switzerland and beat up the nobel committe. They return with some sort of swiss souvenier. I guess I'm going to need spome kind of call in talk show or something to narrate that people think the nobel committee got what was coming to them. Encouraging bad values.

High hatting the common folk. Cultural elete. High hatting the common folk.

Some will demand justice for the nobel committee. Just what biker troll needs. Division.

We need a few mainstreams politiians to come our way. Incremiating pictures with the girls.

A politician. A conversation where biker troll tries to get him on his side. The politician refuses. Biker troll signals somebody who brings him a manilla envelope. The politician looks through the photos. The audience can't see them.

Biker Troll: Roxie did you get a new tattoo?

The politician goes on about High Hatting nobelauriates and values.


High hattin hummus eaters!

Someone shows up on stage with a manella envelope.

Politicians get on board. Soon bi




Unrest, eh? Perfect. They're not the ones protecting the ways of our past, we are. So get over their and whip their asses.



Rick keeps the books. He's been sucked in and can't extract himself. Love grows between he and Clair. Bunion Lou works on his bike. He Clair, Freda and Bunion Lou become discruntled. The other bikers, too. There's no on left to intimidate. They run everything now. What about the deep state? The kicked the ass of a * who complained last week. And thets it. What about the institutions of society? The deep state, you mean?

The beer man learns a secret about Biker Troll and Biker Troll kills him. This is the last straw for Freda. We

learn that Freda and Bunion Lou had been lovers and still carry a torch for each other. They plot to signal interstellar law enforcemtn and have them come for Biker Troll.


They have an intersteller radio and have a conversation with law enforcement. They say they will send some Robots to investigate.

The robots teleport to the bar. They miss the bar and end up in the courtyard outside. Warbly lighty things off stage. The characters hail the robots.

Freda: Frank, Bill, did you collect that unexploded grenade."

Frank and Bill look at each other. An explosion offstage. Robot Parts rain down on the stage. 

Curtain.




Maybe a plot to get interstellar law enforcement to come and arrest him? Do they find some sort of radio? A robot space cop? Two of the characters dressed as robot space cops?




They don't arrest him, though. Turns out he's not wanted for anthing.

Is that how they find out he's not an outlaw?

Maybe the robotr space cop runs his sheet. Somebody seesit and biker troll kills him. How do the others find out?

Maybe he is wanted, but it's a parking ticket or something?

Bunyan Lou Hallister




Maybe something funny happens everytime he tries to start his bike?


Maybe the bar gets progrssively nicer as they get more and more wealthy?

Rick and Clair oppose biker troll. They come up with a gambit. It fails. They get busted.
What's the gambit? Do they discover some weakness? How do they exploit it? Maybe something to do with the grenade? Freda will figure out his weakness.

Freda exposes biker troll as a poser. On his home planet, he's actually a loan officer.
